# Turbidity Sensor Particle Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Turbidity Sensor Particle Sensor project demonstrates how to measure turbidity using an Arduino Nano and a turbidity sensor, also known as a particle sensor. Turbidity sensors are commonly used in water quality monitoring to measure the clarity or cloudiness of a liquid by detecting suspended particles. This project allows you to measure turbidity and monitor water quality by converting analog readings from the sensor into turbidity values in parts per million (PPM).

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Turbidity Sensor (Particle Sensor)**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Turbidity Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the analog output pin of the turbidity sensor to an analog pin on the Arduino Nano (e.g., A0).
   - Connect the VCC (power) and GND (ground) pins of the turbidity sensor to the corresponding VCC and GND pins on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the turbidity sensor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - Observe the turbidity value (analog reading) and the corresponding turbidity value in parts per million (PPM) displayed in the serial monitor.

#### Applications

- **Water Quality Monitoring:** Use turbidity sensors to monitor the clarity of water in environmental monitoring, aquaculture, and wastewater treatment applications.
- **Pollution Detection:** Detect suspended particles in water bodies to identify pollution sources and assess water quality.
- **Process Control:** Implement turbidity sensors in industrial processes to monitor and control the quality of liquids used in manufacturing.

#### Notes

- Calibrate the conversion function `convertToTurbidity()` based on the characteristics and calibration data of your specific turbidity sensor.
- Ensure the turbidity sensor is properly calibrated and configured for accurate turbidity measurements.
- Experiment with different sensor placement and sampling techniques to optimize turbidity measurements for your specific application requirements.
